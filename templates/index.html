	   				<p>In today’s world we have several improvements in technology systems in various fields such as medicine,agriculture and even architecture. When we talk about technology in architecture, the terms that come into our minds are CAD(computer aided design), BIM (building information modelling), VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality) which are being used to enhance the workflow and presentation standards in the field, and in recent times terms such as AI (artificial intelligence), IOT (internet of things), MR (mixed reality) etc. have also seen to have potential for the same, while some the the topics are being debated as in it may reduce the jobs in this field there are supporters as well for these technological advancements.</p>

					<p>In this article however we aren't just focusing on any such debates but would like to highlight the fact that most of these existing technologies are focused mostly on only the visual factor of the human senses and to some extent auditory factors are addressed. When we speak about a space in relation to human sense, the six senses of a human i.e the sense of touch, the sense of smell, the sense of vision, the sense of hearing, the sense of taste, the sense of awareness we mostly address the visual and auditory part alone while designing hence the technology have been developed to aid us with the same, but for instance a person with visual impairment would find it difficult to understand the space with only the two senses (i.e visual and auditory) kept in association while designing.</p>

				    <p>Tactile sense is considered to be the most primary sense that could be related to architecture and if it could also be incorporated while designing it could also serve to address the needs of people with visual impairment. A suggestion for that is the use of specific materials in floors and walls to make people identify the purpose of the space with the help of materials used in the space. In today’s context it's been followed as only to direct them from one space to another and not providing the information of the space through which they travel, hence preventing them from understanding and perceiving the space as any one else could do.</p>

					<p>The tactile as well as olfactory factors in combination could provide more detail of a space in general hence making the space more responsive to humans.maybe in the near future if we could address these senses through technology as well then anyone could be able to understand a space as such for instance in shopping markets one can identify the bakery spot due to the olfactory factor of the yeast produced by the bakery and it tends to attracted people to buy the products but these spaces are provided towards the ends or in corners of the supermarkets so that the customers tend to pass by the other products and hence they could have an range of products to choose and buy from.</p>

					<p>The sense of taste is the least among other senses that could be related to architecture but by proven studies taste could be stimulated through vision by the usage of colours, which is somewhat related to visual sense and is being addressed by technological aid as well, but if we could procure information of colour palette and their psychological effects through the existing technologies it would be a sign of relief and could produce much more options of colors to be discussed and choose from as well. To conclude i would like to say that if we could improve the technologies that are existing to address all the senses of human then we could produce more effective design solutions to the world as architects.</p>
